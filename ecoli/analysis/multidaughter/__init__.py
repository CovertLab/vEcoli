Folder containing analysis scripts that expect to read data for
the daughter cells of a single mother cell. Note that this means
these analyses will only read data for a single cell just like the
analysis scripts in :py:mod:`ecoli.analysis.single` if the workflow
used to generate the simulation output was run with the configuration
option ``single_daughters`` set to True.
