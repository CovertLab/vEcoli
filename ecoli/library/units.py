    '''Split a tree of Quantities into units and magnitudes.

    Args:
        quantity_tree: The nested dictionary representing the tree of
            Quantity objects to split. This tree may also contain
            non-Quantity leaf nodes, which will be treated as unitless
            values.
        expected_units_tree: A nested dictionary of the same shape as
            ``quantity_tree`` specifying expected units for various leaf
            nodes. If a leaf is present in ``quantity_tree`` but not
            ``expected_units_tree``, no assertion will be made as to
            whether that node has units. A Quantity with an associated
            expected unit will be converted to that unit before being
            split.
        path: Path to the root of ``quantity_tree``. Used mainly for
            recursion.

    Returns:
        Two trees (as nested dictionaries), one with the magnitudes and
        another with the units. The units are from after any conversions
        imposed by ``expected_units_tree``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If a leaf node in ``quantity_tree`` unexpectedly has
            no units.
