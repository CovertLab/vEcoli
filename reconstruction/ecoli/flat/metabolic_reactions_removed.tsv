"RXN-12440"	"This is a sum of two reactions. Ascorbate appears on both sides. When it gets parsed as a dict in reconstruction.spreadsheets.JsonReader._decode_row, one of the ascorbate entries gets overwritten, and the reaction becomes unbalanced."
"R15-RXN"	"Generic reaction that often breaks the model. Need to implement generic reactions first."
