Welcome to Vivarium *E. coli*'s documentation!
==============================================

Vivarium *E. coli* is a port of the |text|_ to the `Vivarium framework <https://vivarium-collective.github.io>`_.
For more scientific modeling details, refer to the
`documentation <https://github.com/CovertLab/wcEcoli/tree/master/docs/processes>`_
for the original model as well its corresponding publication
(`10.1126/science.aav3751 <https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav3751>`_).
This website covers how the model was implemented using Vivarium and describes the user interface
for developing and running the model. We recommend new users read through the sections below in order.

   support nesting italics and hyperlinking
