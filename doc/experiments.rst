===========
Experiments
===========

:py:class:`~ecoli.experiments.ecoli_master_sim.EcoliSim` is the primary
interface for configuring and running single-cell simulations. We refer
to simulations as experiments, and all simulations (or batches
of simulations run in a single workflow, see :ref:`/workflows.rst`) are
identified via a unique experiment ID. 

.. warning::
    If data is being persisted to disk (see :ref:`parquet_emitter`), simulations
    or workflows will overwrite data from any past simulations or workflows with
    the same experiment ID.

When running workflows with :py:mod:`runscripts.workflow` (see :ref:`/workflows.rst`),
users are prevented from accidentally overwriting data by ``nextflow``, the software
used to run the workflow. Specifically, nextflow generates an HTML execution report
in the output folder for a given experiment ID (see :ref:`output`)
and will refuse to run another workflow with the same experiment ID unless
that execution report is renamed, moved, or deleted.


.. _sim_config:

-------------
Configuration
-------------

:py:class:`~ecoli.experiments.ecoli_master_sim.EcoliSim` offers three methods
for configuring simulations:

#. Using a JSON configuration file via the command-line option ``--config``
#. Using the object-oriented interface
#. Using command-line options

In general, we recommend that you use the JSON configuration interface as much
as possible. This is because the JSON configuration format is standardized across
all of the main interfaces for the model (the scripts in :py:mod:`runscripts`
and :py:mod:`~ecoli.experiments.ecoli_master_sim`). The object-oriented interface
allows users to programatically set simulation options and is mainly intended for
small ad-hoc test simulations or for creating your own experiment file (see
:ref:`create_experiment`). The command-line interface is much more limited than
the other two and only offers access to a few key configuration options. It is
mainly intended for internal use (e.g. in Nextflow workflow scripts).

.. _json_config:

-----------------
JSON Config Files
-----------------

The :py:class:`~ecoli.experiments.ecoli_master_sim.EcoliSim` class relies upon
the helper :py:class:`~ecoli.experiments.ecoli_master_sim.SimConfig` class to load
configuration options from JSON files and merge them with options specified via
the command line. The configuration options are always loaded in the following order,
with options loaded later on overriding those from earlier sources:

#. The options in the default JSON config file (located at
   :py:data:`~ecoli.experiments.ecoli_master_sim.SimConfig.default_config_path`)
#. The options in the JSON config file specified via ``--config``
   in the command line.
#. The options specified via the command line.

In most cases, configuration options that appear in more than one
of the above sources are successively overriden in their entirety. The sole
exceptions are configuration options listed in
:py:attr:`~ecoli.experiments.ecoli_master_sim.LIST_KEYS_TO_MERGE`. These
options hold lists of values that are concatenated with one another instead
of being wholly overriden.

Notice that the options in the default JSON config file are always loaded
first. This means that if you would like to run a simulation or workflow
that leaves some of these options alone, you can simply omit those options
from the JSON config file that you create and pass to your runscript of choice
via ``--config``.

Below is an annotated copy of the default simulation-related configuration
options from the default JSON config file (see the file located at
:py:data:`~ecoli.experiments.ecoli_master_sim.SimConfig.default_config_path`
for the most up-to-date defaults). Note that JSON configuration files passed
as input to the scripts in :py:mod:`runscripts` accept additional keys that are
documented in :ref:`/workflows.rst`.

Here are some general rules to remember when writing your own JSON config files:

- Strings must be enclosed in double quotes (not single quotes)
- Booleans are lowercase
- None values are written as (unquoted) ``null``
- Trailing commas are not allowed
- Comments are not allowed
- Tuples (e.g. in topologies or flows) are written as lists (``["bulk"]`` instead of ``("bulk",)``)

.. note::
    It is strongly recommended that ``fail_at_total_time`` be set to ``True``
    when running multi-generation workflows. If a simulation reaches total time
    without dividing, this results in a more informative error message instead
    of a Nextflow error about missing daughter cell states.

------
Output
------

If ``emitter`` was set to ``parquet``, then folders containing the simulation output are
created as described in :ref:`parquet_emitter`.

If ``division`` is set to True, :py:mod:`~ecoli.experiments.ecoli_master_sim` will
save the initial states of the two daughter cells resulting from cell division
in ``daughter_outdir`` as JSON files. These files can be moved to the ``data``
folder and passed as ``initial_state_file`` to simulate the daughter cells.
Additionally, the file ``division_time.sh`` will be created in the folder where
you started the simulation. This script, when run, sets the environment variable
``division_time`` to the time at which the cell divided. It is intended for internal
use when running a simulation workflow with :py:mod:`runscripts.workflow`, allowing
Nextflow to correctly set the ``initial_global_time`` for daughter cell simulations.

----------------
Schema Overrides
----------------

One powerful feature of the JSON configuration approach is the ability to override the port schemas
specified by processes. To do so, one simply adds a ``_schema`` key to the config for a process
under the ``process_configs`` option. In the following example, we have overridden the schema for
how the `"ecoli-mass-listener"` process divides the cell mass.

.. code-block::

    "process_configs": {
        "ecoli-mass-listener": {
            "_schema": {
                "listeners": {
                    "mass": {"cell_mass": {"_divider": "set"}}
                }
            }
        }
    }


Another use of schema overrides is to emit data that would normally not be emitted
by setting ``_emit`` to ``True``.

.. code-block::

    "process_configs": {
        "ecoli-mass-listener": {
            "_schema": {
                "unique": {
                    "active_ribosome": {"_emit": true}
                }
            }
        }
    }

.. warning::
    Vivarium includes internal checks to ensure that all ports connected to a
    store give the same or compatible (no conflicting keys) schemas for that store.
    This means that if you would like to override the schema for a store with many
    connecting ports, you will need to override the schemas for all the relevant ports.

------------------
Colony Simulations
------------------

While :py:class:`~ecoli.experiments.ecoli_master_sim.EcoliSim` was only designed
to handle simulation of single cells in isolation,
:py:mod:`~ecoli.experiments.ecoli_engine_process` was made to simulate
multi-cell colonies in shared, dynamic spatial environments.

Engine Process
==============

In simple terms, instances of :py:class:`~ecoli.processes.engine_process.EngineProcess`
wrap an entire Vivarium simulation as a process that can be incremented time step by
time step and interact bidirectionally with the outer simulation. Refer to the API
documentation for :py:mod:`~ecoli.experiments.ecoli_engine_process` for more details.


Configuring Colony Simulations
==============================

All of the configuration
options listed above still apply to simulations started with
:py:mod:`~ecoli.experiments.ecoli_engine_process`. There are only two new options:

- ``engine_process_reports``: List of paths (e.g. ``["bulk"]`` for bulk store) inside
  each cell to save in final colony output.
- ``emit_paths``: List of paths in outer simulation (e.g. locations of each cell in
  spatial environment) to save in final colony output.

In addition to these new configuration options, several previously mentioned options
become much more useful in the context of colony simulations:

- ``save`` and ``save_times`` can be used to create snapshots of the colony state
  to start many colony simulations from, for example, a 16-cell state using
  ``initial_state_file`` without having to wait for 16 generations every time.
  The names of the files saved can be given an optional prefix configured via the
  ``colony_save_prefix`` option.
- ``parallel``: In :py:mod:`~ecoli.experiments.ecoli_engine_process`, each simulated
  cell is contained within a single process (specifically, an instance of
  :py:class:`~ecoli.processes.engine_process.EngineProcess`). Therefore, assuming
  cells only need to communicate a tiny amount of information between one another,
  interprocess overhead is low and running these cells in parallel can greatly speed
  up the colony simulation.
- ``spatial_environment`` and ``spatial_environment_config``: The benefit of running
  simulations inside a shared, dynamic spatial environment is only fully realized when
  many cells are interacting with one another inside this environment.

Create Your Own

For more control over a simulation than what is provided by the default
:py:mod:`~ecoli.experiments.ecoli_master_sim` experiment (as well as the
workflow runscript :py:mod:`runscripts.workflow`, see :ref:`/workflows.rst`),
you can create your own experiment file. Some examples of custom experiment
files in the ``ecoli/experiments`` folder include:

- :py:mod:`~ecoli.experiments.tet_amp_sim`: Modifies the initial state to add
  new bulk molecules (see :ref:`bulk`) for antibiotics-related molecules and
  adds two transcription factor binding sites to all promoters for MarA and MarR.
  Also adds command-line options for external concentration of tetracycline and
  ampicillin.
- :py:mod:`~ecoli.experiments.metabolism_redux_sim`: Replaces the default metabolism
  process (:py:class:`~ecoli.processes.metabolism.Metabolism`) with experimental
  alternatives (e.g. :py:class:`~ecoli.processes.metabolism_redux_classic.MetabolismReduxClassic`).
  Makes use of the object-oriented interface for sim configuration mentioned
  in :ref:`sim_config` (e.g. ``sim.total_time = 100``).
